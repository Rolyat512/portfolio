        My name is Taylor Aldridge and I'm a native Austinite. I attended multiple universities, including universities in London and Tokyo, and graduated from Fort Lewis College with a bachelors degree in Economics.

        
        
        {/* Once I earned my degree in Economics I started my own business installing gutters on peoples homes and businesses. I did this for about 3 years, but ended up selling my business due to covid-19 affecting the supply and prices of metal. 
        
        
        After selling my business I decided to enroll in the UTSA fullstack coding program. I have always enjoyed learning new things and beyond thrilled to find an industry that is always evoling and changing.  */}
        
        
        I recently just completed the FullStack coding program through UTSA and am very excited to dive further into the world of coding. I've always enjoyed learning new things and am beyond thrilled to find an industry that's always evolving.
